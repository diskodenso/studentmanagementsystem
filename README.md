Implementation of generic sorted binary trees using a custom BinTreeGen class (with BinNodeGen) to manage comparable elements, 
forming the backbone of a student management system where Student objects—with unique matriculation numbers, names, 
and courses—are efficiently organized in a sorted binary tree via the StudentManagement class, 
all developed using robust, defensive, and modular programming techniques.
